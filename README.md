Project for Week 8 

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

-We were tasked to build a calculator to find out the ending value of an intial investment with a certain percentage and additional deposits if applicable.

What did you do particularly well?

-The entire function, it worked and worked well. Sure there might be room for improvement, but it works good.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

-I have a few ideas to improve some syntax, both in functionality and overall preformance. Around the initial part of my script, the coding could be optimized a bit more.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

-The coding part was not too difficult since it was a simple calculator. As I said before, the best thing I could do to the code is optimize it some more.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

-C++ being and OOP, the way of thinking and problem solving is usually the same if not similar. It is always good to practice this and prepare you for future problems.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

-Any program is adaptable, of course taking into consideration the size of it. The bigger the program the more difficult it will be to maintain,optimize and read.
